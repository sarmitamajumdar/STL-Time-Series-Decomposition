# STL Decomposition in Python: Time Series Visualization

## Overview
This project demonstrates **Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS (STL)** for **time series data analysis** in Python.  
Using `statsmodels`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`, we break down complex time series into **trend**, **seasonal**, and **residual** components to uncover hidden patterns and visualize them clearly.

## What is STL Decomposition?
**STL (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS)** decomposes a time series into:
- **Trend (Tₜ):** Long-term movement or direction.
- **Seasonal (Sₜ):** Repeating patterns or cycles.
- **Residual (Rₜ):** Random noise or unexplained fluctuations.

## Mathematically:

Yₜ = Tₜ + Sₜ + Rₜ
